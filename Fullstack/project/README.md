# Final Project

The project is split in three main steps:

## 1. Django-MySQL database setup
The basic setup for a Django application that is connected to a MySQL database.

## 2. Booking reservations with API
After setting up the database, this part creates an API that is capable of making booking reservations through the web application. 

## 3. Visualization of Booking Times
Once the API for booking is done, now the web app is improved for selecting booking times, and visualizing the already reserved hours/dates.
